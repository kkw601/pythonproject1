Python Project (Adapted code from the Code First Girls project guide)



For this project, I adapted the code from the example, used a different API and added some features on top of the existing code.

These functions include:

Variables which counts the number of times that the user wins or lost
Ask users if they would like to take a break or continue the game. 
When the counter for the win or loss reaches 10, the programme will stop running. 

The following variables are counter for the user’s stat:
win_stat: variable that increments by 1 when the user wins.
lost_stat:  variable that increments by 1 when the user loses.


Description:
If the win_stat or lost_stat reaches 5, the programme asks the user if they would like to take a break. If users input “Y”, the programme will print the corresponding message and the stats of the user. The programme will then break out of the loop.

Alternatively, if the user enters any other key, the programme will continue to run.  


When the lost_stat or the win_stat reaches 10, the programme will terminate and it will print the number of stats of the users.
